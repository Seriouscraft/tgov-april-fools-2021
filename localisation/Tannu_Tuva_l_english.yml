 POLITICS_DONDUK_KUULAR_DESC:0 "Donduk Kuular was born in 1888 in Shemi in the Qing Dynasty. He studied at a Buddhist monastery where he earned a monastic degree, with this he would become a part of the growing Tuvan intelligentsia. During the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 he was a lamaist monk. But with the aid of the newly formed Mongolian People's Republic he would switch allegiance and establish the Tuvan People's Republic. He would act as the head of state of the young republic, while also holding various government ministries. He has been criticized of being anti-revolutionary, as his policies include Tuvan nationalism and a Buddhist state religion. "
