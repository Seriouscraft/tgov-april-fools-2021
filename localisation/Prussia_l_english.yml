prussia.1.t:0 "Elections!"
prussia.1.d:0 "The upcoming elections of 1936 are bound to be remarkable. The Prussian Republic houses many parties of all ideologies, and every citizen can get their voices heard. Still, there are three parties that are taking the lead. The SPD, Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, is the social democratic party, led by Otto Wels. The DNVP, Deutschnationale Volkspartei, a national conservative party led by Alfred Hugenberg. Finally, the DDP, Deutsche Demokratische Partei, a left liberal party led by Erich Koch-Weser. Although the parties themselves have different policies for the state and the economy, they all share one policy. The policy of German Reunification. This will mark the final election of Prussia, and the first election of Germany."

They talked about politics and private matters. But the Prussian president game him an offer. He would get all his land in Prussia back, if he agreed to become a constituency in Prussia.

As epp found it increasingly attractive to join our federation, there was a plot going on. Bavaria is known for having very great generals. Very talented. The very best generals had been conspiring. See, they enjoyed not being a part of the North German army. They enjoyed their autonomy. So when Epp was drawing closer to us, they had to stop him. Epp was forced into retirement. Now the question of who was to succeed him came. There were various contenders, Franz Halder, Eduard Dietl, Georg von Küchler. But one man rose as the king of the hill; Ferdinand Schörner.

[PRS.GetName] has invaded Bavaria, under the grounds of 'protecting [PRS.GetAdjective] interests'.\n\nThe international community looks on with mixed opinions.

The latest polls show that most of the population would rather join [PRS.GetName] than stay independent. Being a constituency means that we will have some autonomy.

All the new Germans had a greater purpose. They were all sleeper agents and saboteurs. While that is a horrible crime, the biggest offender might be the planned assassination of [BAD.GetLeader].

All war criminals that must be trialed for their crimes against the german people. The Linz Trials have been made to do this. A court that will trial each war criminal for the allegations.

They are incredibly rich and powerful, but they also produce generals and field marshals of the highest caliber. This has lead to the Prussia General Staff to be one of the greatest in not just Europe, but in the entire world. They saw our mistakes in the Great War and learned from it, advancing our doctrine. But their dominance in the General Staff has also come at a cost. They hold almost all power and influence in the armed forces. So much so that low-born generals are shunned upon by the high command, on instances the high command has not sent supplies to low-borns just because they are indeed low-born."
