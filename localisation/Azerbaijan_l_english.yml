 news.1.title:0 "Nariman Narimanov Dies"
 news.1.desc:0 "The nation of Azerbaijan is struck with grief today after learning that Chairman Nariman Narimanov has died of a heart attack the last night. Narimanov took control of Azerbaijan shortly after its independence from Russia following the Great War and was able to turn its traditional Islamic society in to a modernized Jacobin state. He was considered by many to be the leading authority of Jacobinism in the East and his absence will be sorely felt by Turkic and Muslim Jacobins, as well as his wife and only son. The Communist party of Azerbaijan has already announced a party conference to pick Narimanov’s successor, though conservative and authoritarian forces in the country might use this opportunity to depose the Jacobins once and for all."
