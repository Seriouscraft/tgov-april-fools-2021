 POLITICS_SAUD_BIN_ABDULAZIZ:0 "Saud was born in 1898, the golden age of Jabal Shammar. His father was master of Arabia and had destroyed the wretched Saudis once and for all, or so he thought. By the time Saud became Sheikh Nejd was once again under Saudi rule. \n\nSaud tried his best to appease the Saudis, but all he did was delay the inevitable showdown between the two. As the Ikhwan army was preparing its killing blow against 'Abs, a realization hit Saud. If he and his dynasty was to ever find peace in the desert, then appeasement had to end. Very soon the only direction not devastated by the Ikhwan army will be north. They wage war in the name of Allah but only leave destruction in their wake. Luckily Saud's people see these savages for who they really are and know that Allah is on his side. Whether or not that is enough to save him is yet to be seen though, as Ha'il has little time to prepare for the upcoming conflict. One thing is clear though, the destiny of not just Jabal Shammar, but the whole of Arabia hangs in the balance. A great game has been set across the peninsula; the pieces on the board well defined. Sheikh Saud knows, its do or die."
