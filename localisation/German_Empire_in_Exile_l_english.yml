    ## Ideas
 GEX_monarchy_in_exile:0 "The Monarchy in Exile" 
 GEX_monarchy_in_exile_desc:0 "Tragedy befell the Kingdom of Prussia when it lost the Great War to the empire of France. The monarchy was forced to abdicate from the Prussian throne and a republic was put in its stead. Wilhelm II found refuge in his cousin, George V, where he was allowed to stay in Namibia under his protection. It is here that the counter-revolution against democratic ideals will take place."
 GEX_colonial_army:0 "Legacy of the Schutztruppe" 
 GEX_colonial_army_desc:0 "The Schutztruppe were the colonial army of the old Prussian colonial empire, at least what little of it there was. It commonly used labor from the indigenous population of Prussia's overseas territories. Although they were no match for the bolstered French colonial army and beaten, the legacy of such doctrines continue to be seen in today's army, especially the forced labor."
 GEX_british_industrial_influence:0 "British Industrial Influences" 
 GEX_british_industrial_influence_desc:0 "The relationship with [ENG.GetNameDef] goes farther than a simple guarantee of existence. Many British industrial firms invest in Südwestafrika, giving us industrial boon in an otherwise barren desert. This however, comes at a large cost. We will never reap the benefits of resource extraction until we steer the course of investment towards terms more favorable to ourselves."
 GEX_native_strikes:0 "Native Strikes" 
 GEX_native_strikes_desc:0 ""
 GEX_native_reparations:0 "Land Reparation Payments" 
 GEX_native_reparations_desc:0 ""
   ### Decisions
 GEX_reclaiming_the_homeland:0 "Reclaiming the Homeland"
 GEX_reclaiming_the_homeland_desc:0 "The existence of Deutsch-Südwestafrika has always been for one reason and one reason alone: to restore the Kaiser to Berlin. Although we are but a desert territory in the sands of Namibia, not all hope is lost for the German people to see their beloved king once again. One day, we will cross the seas and guard the Rhine once more."
 GEX_form_germany:0 "Triumph of the Kaiserreich"
 GEX_form_germany_desc:0 "At long last, our dream has been realized. The Republicans of Prussia have fled, and Berlin rests in our hands once more. The German Empire, once the long-lost dream of Wilhelm II, now rests in our hands. Heil dir im Siegerkranz!"
 GEX_german_unification_tt:0 "Gain a §Ycore§! on all rightful German lands.\n"

 GEX_unfinished_content_tt:0 "Content for the Namibian revolters is not supported!"
 germanexile.1.t:0 "The Death of the Kaiser"
 germanexile.1.d:0 "Tragedy has befallen [GEX.GetNameDef]. This morning, the Kaiser, Wilhelm II, was found dead inside the palace at the capital. The bells tolled as the people who went with him to this land just short of 20 years wept.\nThe new leader to succeed the \"Mad King\" is his son, Wilhelm III. The international community sees him as a sight for sore eyes, as he is relatively normal compared to his father in his late years, although he has still declared the pursuit of reconquest in Germany. Only time will be able to tell how this prince-turned-king can turn the situation to better tides for our nations."
 germanexile.1.a:0 "The Kaiser is dead, long live the Kaiser!"
 germanexile.2.t:0 "British Company Requests Extraction Rights"
 germanexile.2.d:0 "Today, we have recieved news from a major company dealing with global resource extraction. mainly with gold and diamonds. Their surveyors have found large quantities of diamonds inside of our territory, and with to cut us a deal to recieve sorely needed wealth and employment of our workers. However, this land is on well-defined territory belonging to the natives of the area. Signing the deal with these companies may be good for us, but will undoubtedly lead to conflict with the natives."
 germanexile.2.a:0 "As long as the lines go up, it's a deal."
 germanexile.2.b:0 "We mustn't risk conflicts with the chiefs."
 germanexile.3.t:0 "African Missionaries Request Permission"
 germanexile.3.d:0 "A group of Christian missionaries has requested permission from us to proselytize in native territories. Normally, we don't accept these kinds of requests as they aren't taken too kindly by many of the natives. However, this missionairy group is rather large, and holds considerable influence. Accepting their request will bring us benefits in that regard."
 germanexile.3.a:0 "They are allowed in, only this time."
 germanexile.3.b:0 "Turn them away."
 germanexile.4.t:0 "Ovambo People Demand Justice"
 germanexile.4.d:0 "The people of the Ovambo territory have come to us to demand justice for the death of multiple members of the tribe. Apparently, a group of Afrikaner hunters mistook the members of the tribe scavenging as game, and opened fire on them. Only one survived, and returned to relay the news to the people, now enraged. While they are mad, punishing the hunters will cause us to lose temporary support among the white populations of Südwestafrika."
 germanexile.4.a:0 "There's no evidence of anything happening, move on."
 germanexile.4.b:0 "Publically reprimand the hunters."
 germanexile.5.t:0 "Native Soldiers Deserting"
 germanexile.5.d:0 "Times have not been good for the Schutztruppe. The army heavily relies on native civilians to continue at it's bolstered army, at least compared to the rest of the population. However, there has been an epidemic of native soldiers deserting the army. Many of them are not conscripted with their own consent, but it is becoming a big problem, especially with our already scare manpower supply. Reigning them in will cause them to agitate, however."
 germanexile.5.a:0 "Force the deserters back into the army."
 germanexile.5.b:0 "We do not have the resources for such a thing."
 germanexile.6.t:0 "Death of a Chief"
 germanexile.6.d:0 "A chief in one of the southern provinces of Südwestafrika has recently passed away. He was noted as being a popular figure among the people of his tribe, and even in other tribes he was respected. Truly, he was no ordinary person. This is a moment of perfect opportunity to prove to them we are not just oppressive overlords. However, this will take some political manuevering to pull off."
 germanexile.6.a:0 "He deserves a glorious funeral."
 germanexile.6.b:0 "It is not worth our time."
 germanexile.7.t:0 "Native Figures Eequest Lost Territory"
 germanexile.7.d:0 "Many of the natives in now government land have demanded that we hand back the territories to their respective native lands. This issue has started up since the failed land reforms in 1923, when attempts by the government to carve out more land for us ended in a native revolt. While theoretically, the land was returned, some areas were forgotten, until now. Refusing to pay reparations for the land lost will anger these people."
 germanexile.7.a:0 "Pay reparations for their lost territories."
 germanexile.7.b:0 "Refuse to budge on the issue."
 germanexile.8.t:0 "Excellent Diplomatic Manuevering"
 germanexile.8.d:0 "Times have been good for colonial administration. Thanks to the excellent work of a handful of diplomats, tensions between administration and native governments have subsided. Is this the beginning of normalization of relations?"
 germanexile.8.a:0 "Great!"
 germanexile.9.t:0 "Diplomatic Faux Pas"
 germanexile.9.d:0 "Many of the native populations in the area have been angered over an accidental misunderstanding. In a translation error, an interior diplomat insulted the local chief, instead of greeting him as intended. The people involved have been fired, but the damage has been irreversible."
 germanexile.9.a:0 "This is not good!"
 germanexile.10.t:0 "Native Workers Threaten Strike"
 germanexile.10.d:0 "The Schutztruppe has infamously relied on native labor to produce military weapons for the armed forces. However, an organized force now seems to be occuring among the people. They have threatened us with a strike unless their demands are met. Although accepting all these demands are impossible for a nation like us, we can choose how this scenario plays out among the sparced factories of Namibia."
 germanexile.10.a:0 "The strike will run it's course"
 germanexile.10.b:0 "No quarter for protestors!"
 germanexile.11.t:0 "Atrocities of German Generals"
 germanexile.11.d:0 "News of an atrocity hasve reached the African colonial soldiers in the army, despite our best efforts to cover the story up. A German officer, although not a major one, used natives as target practice while testing out his theories on doctrine. Enraged, the natives have demanded that the German officer must be brought to justice. Court marshaling the officer however, will draw the ire of the German officer corps."
 germanexile.11.a:0 "His findings are too valuable."
 germanexile.11.b:0 "Punish the officer for his crimes."
 germanexile.12.t:0 "The Namibian Revolution of [GetDate]"
 germanexile.12.d:0 "We have been expecting this for quite a while. \nIn 1923, land reforms passed by the previous government ended up in a disaster. The tribes in Damaraland took up arms and waged a months long revolution against the colonial army. This rebellion, however, failed, and the culprits were forced into exile or executed. Another rebellion now has surfaced again, much to our dismay. Samuel Maharero has returned from exile, evidenced by documents from Bechuanaland, and has returned with several key figures to remove the \"colonial menace\". This has proved to be the largest rebellion yet."
 germanexile.12.a:0 "Outrageous!"
 germanexile.12.b:0 "Death to colonialists! (Play as the Revolt)"
 germanexile.13.t:0 "The Revolution Crushed"
 germanexile.13.d:0 "Earlier, Samuel Mahaerero and his gang of Namibian politicians and ministers seized control of the region of Damaraland and have incited a revolt against our government. But now, after capturing the northern frontiers of their land, they have been outgunned and outmatched. Now, they have surrendered to our forces. We have learnt from our last encounter, and the leaders of the revolt were put against the wall. Südwestafrika stands united once again."
 germanexile.13.a:0 "Great!"
