 ###1936 Olympics Games: Each Countries###
#FlavourNews.6.t:0 "Games of the XI Olympiad"
#FlavourNews.6.desc:0 "The eleventh Olympic Games were held in Alexandria, Egypt. It was the first Olympic Games held in a non-western nation, as well as the first African Olympics. The games began with an opening speech from (Egyptian Sultan) in the Alexandria stadium.\n\n4000 athletes from over 40 countries participated in 19 sports for 388 gold, silver and bronze medals. France came out on top with 20 gold medals, while the United States, Prussia and Sweden all showed strong performances. Egypt was able to snatch two gold medals and beat the world record on weightlifting, but their real victory was the Olympics itself. Foreign participants were stunned by the beauty and modernity of host city.  Egypt has once again proven itself to be just as westernized as its European counterparts, while still keeping its Eastern charm."

Olympics1.1.t:0 "Afghanistan in the Olympics"
Olympics1.1.d:0 "Most Afghanis do not know or care about the Olympic Games, but not this year. Our field hockey team beat all expectations. They started off with a 3-0 win over the United States and then another win over Flanders. These successes were mentioned in newspapers around the world, but sadly that is where our success ended.  A 6-6 tie with Denmark resulted in our elimination from the games. With victory so close, much of the youth in Afghanistan are clamouring to be part of the next games field hockey team.\n\nNew Field Hockey teams are popping up all the country. This unknown sport has become a household name overnight. Now the only question that remains is whether or not we lend support to this organic movement. It might just be what we need to create a unified Afghani sense of identity."
Olympics1.1.a:0 "They don’t need our help"
Olympics1.1.b:0 "Get ready for Sydney 1940!"

Olympics1.2.t:0 "Poyais in the Olympics"
Olympics1.2.d:0 "Poyais has proudly participated in all of the modern Olympiads since 1896. More importantly, our humble country has racked up a fine collection of gold, silver and bronze that would leave most countries in shame.\n\nThis year was no different. Cissie Stewart, a hardy Scotswoman came back victorious with a silver medal in swimming. We once again proved that despite our small size, lacklustre sporting facilities and non-existent funding, the athletes of Poyais are still the strongest and fastest.\n\nTo Billy though, the Olympics tell a different story, a story of discrimination and rejection. To him, the future of the Olympics is with machines, specifically aeroplanes. Running a marathon is a great feat, but flying over the Atlantic is just as, if not more fantastic. For more than a decade he has written letter after letter to the Olympic committees, the organizers, host cities and anyone else whose address he could find.  During the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics Billy even planned to fly over the city and land right on the stadium during the opening ceremony. His advisors gave him enough wine the day before to make sure he would not get out of bed, let alone travel half the continent.\n\nSo far he has received no replies. Some postal workers have claimed that the letters were burned by Billie’s own advisers to save grace, but there is no proof of this"
Olympics1.2.a:0 "I guess we will never know..."

Olympics1.3.t:0 "Mexico in the Olympics"
Olympics1.3.d:0 "After more than two weeks of running, swimming and fighting, Mexico’s greatest athletes have returned from Alexandria with 3 bronze medals. People all over Mexico tuned in to the radio and heard live as we won in boxing and water polo. The most anticipated game was the basketball semifinal.  Our boys put up a good fight, but lost 25-10 to the United States and only got bronze.\n\nMany of the settlers communities in the north cheered as the Americans won the semifinals and went on to win gold.  This has caused some politicians to call for the deportation of those who support other countries over Mexico in sporting competitions.President [MEX.GetLeader] knows better than to let nationalistic sentiments get in the way of good profits. Who cares which country the settlers root for? They still pay their taxes to Mexico and Mexico alone."
Olympics1.3.a:0 "We didn’t need the gold anyway, we have California for that"

Olympics1.4.t:0 "United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves in the Olympics"
Olympics1.4.d:0 "110 athletes left Rio de Janeiro for Alexandria. They returned with the same number of medals that they started with, zero. The fact that our great nation of 35 million failed to win in a single competition is disgraceful!\n\nEveryone, from the Olympic committee chair to the coach of the fencing team, is busy playing the blame game. This has begun to creep into politics as well. some politicians have gone so far as to blame us directly. The Cortes Gerais is full of allegations that we used the Olympic budget on lavish parties. While obviously untrue, our popularity would begin to nosedive if we don’t address these issues now.\n\nWe could allocate more funding for sports clubs and begin preparations for the next Olympiad as soon as possible. It would also be a relatively cheap way to instil patriotism among the youth and show off our kingdom’s successes for the world to see."
Olympics1.4.a:0 "Increase funding and encourage sports in schools"
Olympics1.4.b:0 "We do not need some games to be proud of being Portuguese!"

Olympics1.5.t:0 "New South Wales in the Olympics"
Olympics1.5.d:0 "The Olympic experience in Egpyt was rocky at first, to say the least. Our athletes were thought to be from  New Holland at the airport by the organizers themselves and almost ended walking under their flag in the opening ceremony. To make things worse some athletes got into a bar fight with members of the Russian national team. Two of our boxers went home with broken bones that day and could not participate in the game.\n\nAll in all the games of the XI Olympiad were shaping up to be a disaster. This was all quickly forgotten though, as New South Wales scored its greatest success in Olympic history!\n\nRunner Jack Lovelock not only got the gold medal in 3 minutes and 47 seconds at the 1500m’s event but broke the world record. He was congratulated by virtually everyone at the stadium. The flag of New South Wales proudly flew over the cool Mediterranean breeze.  New Holland’s own runner, Tinus Osendarp only got bronze and was left humiliated. Now no one will mistake our great runners for their pathetic limping little girls.\n\nWhen the athletes finally got home, they complained about the length of the flight from Alexandria to Melbourne.  Luckily, when the time for the next Olympics comes, we can just walk."
Olympics1.5.a:0 "If people thought that Alexandria was a gorgeous city, then Sydney will blow them all away!"

Olympics1.6.t:0 "Switzerland in the Olympics"
Olympics1.6.d:0 "Switzerland is mostly known for its success in the winter Olympics.  When it was announced that Alexandria would host the summer Olympics, we were counted out of the competition almost immediately. Observers said that the Alpine people could never survive the Saharan heat. The world was proven wrong once again, as Swiss athletes won 15 medals in 6 sports.\n\nThe great win came from sports star Georges Miez, who earned a gold medal in gymnastics, the fourth in his career.  Not even the Egyptian sun could stop our champions. Switzerland artists also got a chance to show off its artistic skills. Alex Diggelmann painting earned him global praise. His piece, the “Arosa I Placard" showed the internationalist spirit of the games.\n\nMost foreigners only recognize Switzerland for its banks and chocolate, now they will know us for our athleticism too. The national team is already preparing for the next games in Australia with great enthusiasm."
Olympics1.6.a:0 "Wait, Sydney is not in Austria?"

Olympics1.7.t:0 "The Republic of Canada in the Olympics"
Olympics1.7.d:0 "The summer Olympics attracts little interest in the Republic of Canada and with good reason. Not once in the games 40-year history have we won a single competition. This year was no different.  The closet we came was with Bertrand Boissonnault in fencing, but even he was eliminated in the semi-finals. These failures are beginning to damage our international prestige.\n\nSome say that the problem comes from a lack of funding. The cold weather of Canada makes it hard to prepare for the summer games and creating indoor stadiums would greatly increase training times. Others think that that we should just give up on the summer Olympics altogether and put all of our efforts in the winter games instead. This position is especially popular now, as we failed to gain gold in Hockey for the first time 20 years during the winter Olympics."
Olympics1.7.a:0 "Why limit our victories to one season?"
Olympics1.7.b:0 "Summer is for rest, not work"\n\n

Olympics1.8.t:0 "Sweden in the Olympics"
Olympics1.8.d:0 "Most nations of the world show their might by wasting money on guns or bullying those below them. Sweden does not concern itself with such wasteful and aggressive antics. We are a healthy and happy people who use our might to help others. Athletics and the Olympics is the best way to channel our strength into something positive for the world to see.\n\nThis year’s Olympics were no different. The Muslim and Arab world’s got their first glimpse of Swedish prowess. They were not disappointed. The return flight from Alexandria came with the extra baggage six gold, five silver and nine bronze medals, twenty in total. Our greatest success was in wrestling, a sport popular with the locals.  Swedish men demonstrated their superiority over their peers by winning four gold medals. Egyptian women were gushing at the mere sight of our athletes. \n\nA few coaches and athletes complained that this was our worst performance in 20 years, but most Swedes did not care. When people heard on the radio about our victories in wrestling, fencing and shooting they cheered louder than ever before."
Olympics1.8.a:0 "They need to stop complaining and enjoy life"

Olympics1.9.t:0 "Hannover in the Olympics"
Olympics1.9.d:0 "Hanover has never been particularly successful at the Olympics. Many of the country's popular sports are considered too aristocratic to be enjoyed by the commoners. If croquet was an Olympics sport then we would have had gold medals a long time ago. Luckily, there is still some hope for Hanover.\n\nErwin Sietas is considered by many to be Europe’s greatest breaststroke swimmer. He won gold in the 1934 Magdeburg championships, so hopes were high that his success would repeat in the Olympics as well. Sadly, it was not meant to be. Erwin started off in the lead but was surpassed at the last moment by a Japanese athlete.\n\nEveryone in Hanover, including the king, was disappointed as the news broke on the radio. Hanover has never gotten gold in the Olympics and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. When Erwin himself was asked about his performance he said that it could be better and promised to win gold at the next games in Sydney."
Olympics1.9.a:0 "Silver is better than nothing"

Olympics1.10.t:0 "Baden in the Olympics"
Olympics1.10.d:0 "If you asked the average commoner of Baden about the Olympics, they would think it was the name of some foreign dish. Even the ruling class has little interest in sports like basketball and weightlifting. This is most exemplified by the treatment of the Olympic team itself.\n\nThe athletes had to fly on a commercial airliner and paid for accommodations with their own pockets. It looked like they were on an extended summer vacation. That was until Baden won first place in Team Gymnastics. It was a stunning upset that shocked the world. In fact, no one from Baden bothered to cover the event. It was only after an announcement on the local radio that our reporters showed up just in time to take photos of the medal awarding ceremony. \n\n[BAD.GetLeader] is busy at work memorizing the names of all the athletes and preparing the welcoming ceremony. It is said that the king dabbled in gymnastics during his youth and is keen to raise national interest in the sport. Some of this excitement has spread to the public and they are preparing their own ceremonies. Karlshure airport's runway is about to greet its first-ever Olympics champions."
Olympics1.10.a:0 "Success comes from where you least expect it"

Olympics1.11.t:0 "Mecklenburg in the Olympics"
Olympics1.11.d:0 "Equestrianism holds a special place in grand duke Francis IV's heart.  He has been on a saddle ever since he was old enough to walk. In the 1932 Olympics, he personally represented Mecklenburg but got lost place and came home in disgrace. Thankfully, these days the grand duke only rides for personal pleasure and not international competitions\n\nFor this year's games, Mecklenburg has sent Ludwig Stubbendorf and his horse Nurmi. The best equestrian in all of Germany was handpicked and spent the whole practising in the practising in the royal stables.  The grand duke even planned on going to Egypt and watching the games himself. Unfortunately, due to last-minute health complications, he could not go and his son, heir apparent Friedrich Franz, went to view the games instead. As soon as Ludwig crossed the finish line and earned first place, Friedrich called his father to let him know. He said that he had not heard his father be so happy for years.\n\nWhen Ludwig came back the grand duke added another prize to his chest: The Order of the Griffon Grand Cross. Ludwig nearly broke down in tears of joy and said that serving Mecklenburg is the greatest honour of his life.  His horse Nurmi was also given a medal and a lifetime supply of hay from the state budget."
Olympics1.11.a:0 "Everyone liked that"

Olympics1.12.t:0 "Bavaria in the Olympics"
Olympics1.12.d:0 "In terms of Olympics glory, Bavaria has always outshined her German sisters. Our neighbours might not agree with us, but Alexandria showed them otherwise. München was greeted by seven gold medals yesterday, second only to Prussia.\n\nWe have one man to thank for this splendid result: Alfred Schwarzmann. His brilliant Gymnastics routine earned him and Bavaria three gold and two bronze medals. Filled with pan-nationalist pride, many of the German spectators began chanting "Alfred" regardless if they were Bavarian or not.  If it was not for that American runner Jesse Ownes, he would have been the most successful athlete of the Olympics!\n\nThe sensation of success was nearly ruined by the Westphalians. Rather than accept defeat they have announced their own "victory" since they earned one more medal than us on the total tally. The latest copy of the Frankfurter Zeitung proudly proclaims "17 medals, second-best in Germany!". This insult has only further raised tensions between our two states. Some in the government are preparing to sue the newspapers for libel, but it is not expected to go anywhere. The people of Bavaria are happy with their victories, whether or not the rest of the world appreciates them. "
Olympics1.12.a:0 "Those Westphalians couldn't hold a gun if their life depended on it"

Olympics1.13.t:0 "Saxony in the Olympics"
Olympics1.13.d:0 "Like any true German aristocrat, King Georg enjoys equestrianism almost as much as he enjoys military parades.  This year the king had something special in mind. A gold medal in equestrian would let the whole world know that Saxony is the most cultured of the German states.\n\nOur athletes performed well in other sports and earned 2 gold medals. The last competition was the equestrian. It was up to them whether  Saxony made history or not. The team's performance at the dressage section was mediocre, to say the least. We were in sixth place and our chances of winning bronze, let alone gold was near zero. \n\nThen God threw his lot with us. Every single team failed spectacularly at the cross country event. Half of them were disqualified and rest were thousands of points in the negative. Only one team got out of the event unscratched and that was, of course, Saxony. The stunned competition could do little more than humbly congratulate our team. \n\nThe press has described the whole event as the Miracle of the House of Wettin. King Georg himself could not agree more and has ordered the minting of special coins just the occasion."
Olympics1.13.a:0 "They almost had us in the first"

Olympics1.14.t:0 "Westphalia in the Olympics"
Olympics1.14.d:0 "In a country, as divided as Westphalia, sport is a unifying theme. Some political commentators joke that every sports competition distracts just long enough for the country to stay together. The Olympics is the most important of all the sports competitions and so in these trying times, it was a welcome distraction. \n\nThere was a surprising amount of female athletes this year. \n\nTilly Fleischer's javelin throwing and Helene Mayer's fencing, in particular, were noteworthy. Our male athletes did not shy away from victory either, with upset wins in canoeing and field hockey. \n\nThe men and women of Westphalia stunned the world with their great performance and racked up 17 medals. \n\n[WST.GetLeader] has decided to honour this achievement by organizing an Olympic parade through Kassel. All the athletes from past Olympics participate, with the winners at the front. Local sports clubs have also joined to celebrate and walk behind the athletes. \n\nOne would think that inviting all the Olympics athletes would be a straightforward and unanimous affair, but life in Westphalia is never that simple. Helene Mayer's inclusion has created a scandal. Her Jewish background has angered some in right-wing circles. (Add right-wing politician here)has said that only "real" Germans should participate in the parade. \n\nWhile his argument is obviously preposterous, there is a practical reason to accept it. Sacrificing one athlete to quell the rising discontent of the right is a tempting price."
Olympics1.14.a:0 "She is more Westphalian than these politicians ever will be"
Olympics1.14.b:0 "Fencing is not that important anyway"
